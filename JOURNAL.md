This is my journal of the design and building process of **3D Vase**.

## 10/15/2025 3 PM - Created a new form for my vase  

So I used youtube and learned more about vase and form tool and then started using foam tool! I got to know about diameter and height faces and how you can use symmetry to make things easily and learned about a new thing and pressing and holding ALT can do extrude! now I got a little bit vase looking thing :yay: :)

## 10/15/2025 4 PM - Gave it a good shape!  

As I got to know about form tools I started exploring them and while learning I got to know about bulging and to make crease! 
So I continued designing the current thing!! Initial when trying to drag and make a good shape I got a fusion error of overlapping and shit and I was confused asf :( :sob: but then I just tried fixing it but no help and idk why that happened but I just undo and redo and got back and redo and then this is what I have right now![Untitled.png](https://blueprint.hackclub.com/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MjMxNiwicHVyIjoiYmxvYl9pZCJ9fQ==--daa108d6464a8de7c130f79c727beb4b0f813fb7/Untitled.png)
  

## 10/15/2025 5 PM - Made the spiral and filled volume!  

So I continued working on the shape and the spiral thing!
First I fixed my ugly looking vase by changing the bulges for each layer seperately I didin't used any fix measurements just played around and found the good looking ones! :hehehehe:
then I started to work on the spiral which I didn't knew how so I went to YT and found that I needed to rotate in the edit form tab and then I used the boundary fill to make a 3D model of it and made 2 offset planes :yay: now it looks way more good tbh

## 10/15/2025 6 PM - Completed the full vase!!!  

**Completed the full vase!!!**
worked on a little bit improving the design and then started to make the hole!
this was to most difficult thing as I tried using offset but things really fucked up and fusion started to gave me unwanted errors :(
Then I tried using the spline tool and it did alot of work easily :yay: I made a rough spline and then used the revolve to cut out the cyckinder or whatever you name that shape lol
Made it into the bambu slicer and then set a 3 wall cause I can't risk breaking it :prayge: and I don't want it to fell with wind :) 
the ending part was again abit boring and irritating to get good shapes and especially spline idk why it just turns the opposite way :cry:
**_now its all done yayyy_**
