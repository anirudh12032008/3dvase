## 10/15/2025 - Created a new foam for my vase  

So I used youtube and learned more about vase and foam tool and then started using foam tool! I got to know about diameter and height faces and how you can use symmetry to make things easily and learned about a new thing and pressing and holding ALT can do extrude! now I got a little bit vase looking thing :yay: :)
